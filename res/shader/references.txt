for the correct vectors Eq. 20 and Fig. 6
i = where light is incoming, o= light outgoing
m = is microsurface normal
n = is macrosurface normal
thus i = Direction to light, o = direction to viewer
Assuming microfacets are perfect mirrors, we need a direct connection from viewer to light, a distribution of mirrors makes this a non infinitesimal direction where light is directed,
 normal Distribution D(m) gives us the necessary information how the perfect mirrors lead to a smooth highlight
 by plugging in normalized h_r, which is the half vector (see fig.6) between which vectors though?

says that dielectrocis have achromatic specular reflectance
but conductors use their base color as specular color
"Metallic" says whether its a dielectric (metallic = 0) or a conductors(metallic = 1), often used as binary value see Table 2

many good hints in filament/Filament
see https://google.github.io/filament/Filament.html#materialsystem/dielectricsandconductors

TODO replace specular color definition by metallic property (use "achromatic" color when metallic = 0, but use color as specular color when metallic==1, and use uniforms everywhere... if there is no reason to computing it in the shader)
